# Emotion-Lite AI: A Minimalist Framework for Emotion-Driven Agents

## ðŸš§ Concept Overview

This repo presents a conceptual model for designing AI agents driven by **only two emotional primitives**:

- **Desire** â€“ the pursuit of goals or rewards
- **Anxiety** â€“ the tension or urgency caused by obstacles, uncertainty, or the risk of failure

The thesis is simple:

> Human behaviorâ€”and by extension, AI agent behaviorâ€”can be effectively modeled by desire constrained by anxiety. Anger, frustration, sadness, and other complex emotions may be unnecessary for functional intelligence or adaptive behavior.

## ðŸ’¡ Core Idea

### Traditional Emotional AI:
- Attempts to simulate a wide range of human emotions (joy, anger, sadness, empathy)
- Is complex, hard to control, and often unnecessary outside of high-social-fidelity use cases

### Emotion-Lite AI:
- Defines an agentâ€™s **emotional state as a scalar or bounded range**, constrained to a tension between goal pursuit and obstacle awareness
- Uses **anxiety** as a dynamic internal signal to trigger planning shifts, caution, retries, or abandonment
- Maintains **desire** as a driving force behind decision-making, exploration, and goal-directed behavior

## ðŸ§  Design Outline

```python
class EmotionLiteAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.desires = []          # List of goals
        self.anxiety = 0.0         # Scalar, 0.0 = calm, 1.0 = panic
        self.emotion_state = "engaged"  # Or "cautious", "hesitant", etc.

    def evaluate_environment(self, stimuli):
        if stimuli.obstacle:
            self.anxiety += 0.1
        if stimuli.progress:
            self.anxiety = max(0.0, self.anxiety - 0.05)

    def plan_behavior(self):
        if self.anxiety < 0.3:
            return plan_direct_action(self.desires)
        elif self.anxiety < 0.7:
            return plan_with_fallbacks(self.desires)
        else:
            return retreat_or_request_help()
