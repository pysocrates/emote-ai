# Emotion-Lite AI: A Minimalist Framework for Emotion-Driven Agents
## TL;DR
This repo proposes a minimalist emotional framework for artificial agents:  
**Desire** drives behavior, **anxiety** regulates it.  
Forget anger, frustration, or sadness—they're emergent, not essential.

## 🚧 Concept Overview

This repo presents a conceptual model for designing AI agents driven by **only two emotional primitives**:

- **Desire** – the pursuit of goals or rewards
- **Anxiety** – the tension or urgency caused by obstacles, uncertainty, or the risk of failure

The thesis is simple:

> Human behavior—and by extension, AI agent behavior—can be effectively modeled by desire constrained by anxiety. Anger, frustration, sadness, and other complex emotions may be unnecessary for functional intelligence or adaptive behavior.

## 💡 Core Idea

### Traditional Emotional AI:
- Attempts to simulate a wide range of human emotions (joy, anger, sadness, empathy)
- Is complex, hard to control, and often unnecessary outside of high-social-fidelity use cases

### Emotion-Lite AI:
- Defines an agent’s **emotional state as a scalar or bounded range**, constrained to a tension between goal pursuit and obstacle awareness
- Uses **anxiety** as a dynamic internal signal to trigger planning shifts, caution, retries, or abandonment
- Maintains **desire** as a driving force behind decision-making, exploration, and goal-directed behavior

## 🧠 Design Outline

```python
class EmotionLiteAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.desires = []          # List of goals
        self.anxiety = 0.0         # Scalar, 0.0 = calm, 1.0 = panic
        self.emotion_state = "engaged"  # Or "cautious", "hesitant", etc.

    def evaluate_environment(self, stimuli):
        if stimuli.obstacle:
            self.anxiety += 0.1
        if stimuli.progress:
            self.anxiety = max(0.0, self.anxiety - 0.05)

    def plan_behavior(self):
        if self.anxiety < 0.3:
            return plan_direct_action(self.desires)
        elif self.anxiety < 0.7:
            return plan_with_fallbacks(self.desires)
        else:
            return retreat_or_request_help()

```
## 🔎 Why Not More Emotions?
> You don’t need anger—just an anxious desire that isn’t being fulfilled.
> You don’t need sadness—just lowered desire intensity over time.
> You don’t need frustration—just escalating anxiety under blocked conditions.
## This framework:

Simplifies affective modeling for agents
- Enables more predictable and stable behavior
- Avoids manipulation or emotional uncanny valley
- Encourages action-oriented, interpretable behavior

## 🌍 Use Cases
- Autonomous agents and copilots with bounded emotional variance
- Industrial robotics or field systems needing goal adaptation under uncertainty
- AI safety agents requiring emotional transparency and predictability
- Simulation AI for games, tutoring systems, or virtual companions

## 📌 Future Directions
- Expand with bounded memory (emotions influenced by past events)
- Combine with reinforcement learning to tune anxiety as a pseudo-intrinsic reward signal
- Investigate how this maps to real-world human-expert systems (e.g., pilots, surgeons, military)

## ⚡ Quote Worth Remembering
“Emotion isn’t decoration—it’s regulation. And all an AI really needs is a desire to succeed, and just enough anxiety to avoid failing.”

## 📥 Feedback
Rs and discussions welcome. This is not a codebase—yet—but a prompt for systems designers, AI safety thinkers, and anyone who believes simple things done well can reshape how we think about intelligence.
